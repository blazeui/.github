# Contributing

For any contribution first create a new branch.

> It is recommended to use git flow approach to prefix your branch name `fix/`, `feature/` or `docs/` to provide initial indication of the purpose of your PR.

Make your changes and after commiting all to your branch create a new PR to merge to `main` branch.

Your PR will then be reviewed and merged if approved.
