## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are not providing support for Meteor itself. See their [SECURITY](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/SECURITY.md) for more information.

Any security concerns should be first raised in the repository of the affected package.
If you want to report a vulnerability privately please contact the maintainer of the package directly.
If you are not sure who that is you can contact one of the following people and they will take it from there:
